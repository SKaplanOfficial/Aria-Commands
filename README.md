# Aria-Commands
This repository contains various commands for Aria, a contextually-aware, tinker-friendly virtual assistant. Visit [Aria's GitHub repository](https://github.com/SKaplanOfficial/Aria) to learn how Aria might fit into your workflow.

The commands of this repository are organized according to their level of stability and development status. _Stable_ and _Experimental_ commands are both actively developed, but _Stable_ commands are more likely to work with the current version of Aria. _Command Stubs_ are partially implemented ideas for commands that may or may not function. _Deprecated_ and _Obsolete_ commands are kept for reference. An index of commands, their creators, creation date, last modified date, and requirements is provided below. Additional utilities, developer reference material, other useful resources are listed at bottom.

## Stable Commands
These commands aren't required by Aria, but you might find some of them useful. Commands provide additional features that many may find useful (while others may have no need for them). These extra commands deliver more niche featuresets while staying generally up-to-date with the main Aria branch.

## Experimental Commands
These commands are _unfinished_ and potentially highly _unstable_, so you should use them with caution. directory have no guarantee of being up-to-date, functional, or even useful. Experiments aim to find new ways to use Aria, to identify new technologies or methodologies, and to test new ideas quickly. Experimental commands may lack stability and documentation, but they can be a good place to look for inspiration for command creators.
